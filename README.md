- I didn't have time because of work to integrate Carthage for Quick and Nimble - please review other recent code challenges which such as REA (TramTracker for Quick and Nimble unit Test Integration)


I belive I implemented very clean Swift code. I have implemented the hard parts and I am at a point where I can implement a lot more functionalties with a much enhanced UI but only because of time constraints I wasn't able to.

Implemented using Xcode Version 10.2.1 (10E1001) and Swift 5.0
